It uses a series of facial gestures of the listener, quantized by VQ-VAE, and feeds these gestures as additional language markers into a large transformer-based language model. The generated listener actions are fluent and reflect language semantics.\nFor example, if the speaker said something happy, the model would make the virtual audience laugh; if the speaker said something uncomfortable, the model would make the virtual audience frown.\nThe advantage of this is that the generated facial movements are not only natural, but also accurately reflect the speaker’s intentions and emotions, making the chatbot more like a real listener.\n","slug":"Can-Language-Models-Learn-to-Listen","date":"2023-08-30T06:57:26.000Z","categories_index":"AIGC","tags_index":"Vision","author_index":"FossBuy"},{"id":"1337ac1ac6dc10acd3fd4360edfba2de","title":"3D Gaussian Splatting for Real-Time Radiance Field Rendering","content":"3D Gaussian Splatting: Only a set of photos or a video is needed to quickly generate a 3D model.\nSite: https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/GitHub: https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splattingLicense: Gaussian-Splatting License (free for non-commercial, research and evaluation)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nAnd this 3D model not only looks real, but also easier and faster to make than other methods.\nIt uses a mathematical tool called “3D Gaussian function” to represent this 3D model, and finds a faster algorithm to render (i.e. generate) the 3D model. #gaussiansplatting\nEasy to understand explanation:\nImagine you have a bunch of photos or videos and you want to see the scenes from a whole new perspective. 3D Gaussian Splatting is an advanced tool that allows you to do just that. It “recreates” these scenes in an exceptionally fast and high-quality manner, allowing you to view them from any angle as if you were actually standing there.\nThe “brain” of the tool uses a mathematical model called a 3D Gaussian that describes every detail of the scene with great precision. Even cooler, the tool also displays these new angles of the scene in real-time, meaning you don’t have to wait long to see the results.\n","slug":"3D-Gaussian-Splatting","date":"2023-08-29T14:13:51.000Z","categories_index":"AIGC","tags_index":"Vision","author_index":"FossBuy"},{"id":"65f60956c3207b3b6622abbe02a00143","title":"WizardLM: Empowering Large Pre-Trained Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions","content":"WizardLM team brings their three new models recently: WizardCoder, WizardLM, WizardMath.\nGitHub: https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLMLicense: Apache-2.0\nThe coding evaluation benchmark looks really amazing:\n\n\n","slug":"WizardLM","date":"2023-08-21T09:56:32.000Z","categories_index":"LLM","tags_index":"Model","author_index":"FossBuy"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
