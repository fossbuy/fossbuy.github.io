It “recreates” these scenes in an exceptionally fast and high-quality manner, allowing you to view them from any angle as if you were actually standing there.\nThe “brain” of the tool uses a mathematical model called a 3D Gaussian that describes every detail of the scene with great precision. Even cooler, the tool also displays these new angles of the scene in real-time, meaning you don’t have to wait long to see the results.\n","slug":"3D-Gaussian-Splatting","date":"2023-08-29T14:13:51.000Z","categories_index":"AIGC","tags_index":"Vision","author_index":"FossBuy"},{"id":"65f60956c3207b3b6622abbe02a00143","title":"WizardLM: Empowering Large Pre-Trained Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions","content":"WizardLM team brings their three new models recently: WizardCoder, WizardLM, WizardMath.\nGitHub: https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLMLicense: Apache-2.0\nThe coding evaluation benchmark looks really amazing:\n\n\n","slug":"WizardLM","date":"2023-08-21T09:56:32.000Z","categories_index":"LLM","tags_index":"Model","author_index":"FossBuy"},{"id":"b9663f58f18133b35bfe243f3e916a80","title":"Hello World","content":"Welcome to Hexo!
