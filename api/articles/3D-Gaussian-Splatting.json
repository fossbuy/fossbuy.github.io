It “recreates” these scenes in an exceptionally fast and high-quality manner, allowing you to view them from any angle as if you were actually standing there.</p>\n<p>The “brain” of the tool uses a mathematical model called a 3D Gaussian that describes every detail of the scene with great precision. Even cooler, the tool also displays these new angles of the scene in real-time, meaning you don’t have to wait long to see the results.</p>\n","text":"3D Gaussian Splatting: Only a set of photos or a video is needed to quickly gene...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"1.2k","symbolsTime":"1 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"AIGC","slug":"AIGC","count":2,"path":"api/categories/AIGC.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"Vision","slug":"Vision","count":2,"path":"api/tags/Vision.json"}],"toc":"","author":{"name":"FossBuy","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"static/img/logo.png","link":"/","description":"We help you discover Interesting AIGC & Web3 opensource projects, and tutorials how to build, deploy and appy them.
