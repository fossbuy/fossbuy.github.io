With the advent and prospering of large language models (LLMs), there is an expanding frontier in using LLMs as core controllers for these autonomous entities.</p>\n<p>Paper: <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11432\">https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11432</a></p>\n<p>GitHub: <a href=\"https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey\">https://github.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paitesanshi/LLM-Agent-Survey/main/assets/architecture.png\" alt=\"Construction of LLM-based Autonomous Agent\"></p>\n<p>However, a unified view that ties together the diverse studies in this field has been lacking. This repository houses a comprehensive and systematic survey that fills this gap, focusing on LLM-based autonomous AI agents in their construction, applications, and evaluation strategies.</p>\n<p>In particular, we explore the essential components of an AI agent, including a profile module, a memory module, a planning module, and an action module. We further investigate the potential applications in natural and social sciences and introduce methods to evaluate their effectiveness. Challenges and future directions of this field are also discussed.</p>\n<p>The paper and repository aim to serve as a resource for researchers and practitioners alike, providing insights, related references, and continuous updates on this exciting and rapidly evolving field.</p>\n","text":"Autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents are designed to accomplish specif...","link":"","photos":[],"count_time":{"symbolsCount":"1.3k","symbolsTime":"1 mins."},"categories":[{"name":"Agent","slug":"Agent","count":1,"path":"api/categories/Agent.json"}],"tags":[{"name":"Survey","slug":"Survey","count":1,"path":"api/tags/Survey.json"}],"toc":"","author":{"name":"FossBuy","slug":"blog-author","avatar":"static/img/logo.png","link":"/","description":"We help you discover Interesting AIGC & Web3 opensource projects, and tutorials how to build, deploy and appy them.
